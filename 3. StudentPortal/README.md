# Student Portal (Portfolio)

### Requirements

We need to build an application where you can manage all the portals you need for your study.  One screen shows the portal using a webview. The other screen is responsible for adding portal.

This is an example of how the end-result may look:

![student portal: List of websites](https://github.com/MarjoleinAardewijn/MobileApplicationDevelopment/blob/master/3.%20StudentPortal/student-portal-1.png)
![student portal:  Webview showing the actual websites](https://github.com/MarjoleinAardewijn/MobileApplicationDevelopment/blob/master/3.%20StudentPortal/student-portal-2.png)
![student portal: adding sites](https://github.com/MarjoleinAardewijn/MobileApplicationDevelopment/blob/master/3.%20StudentPortal/student-portal-3.png)

First screen shows the portals, if you click on a portal it navigates to the portal in the second screen. If you click on the floating button you can add portals.
