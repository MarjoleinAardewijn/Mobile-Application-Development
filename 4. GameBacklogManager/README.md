# Game Backlog (Portfolio)

### Requirements

We need to create an application where you can keep track of which games you have played and which games you still want to play. The games are locally stored.

The games are shown using a cardview widget. You can add games using the floating button. If you click a game you can edit this game. Using a swipe gesture you can remove a game.

There are four status options for a game:

- Want to play
- Playing
- Stalled
- Dropped

The colors are provided:

```xml
<resources>
   <color name="colorPrimary">#009688</color>
   <color name="colorPrimaryDark">#00796B</color>
   <color name="colorAccent">#00695C</color>
   <color name="colorBackgroundDark">#3d3d3d</color>
</resources>
```
